<!-- - Tweak reasoning prompts - reasoning statement should focus on the impact to users in clear, simple, non-ambiguous terms, not the score or website. -->

<!-- - If a tag is not found, add the tag to the db after analysis. -->
<!-- - Make sure that the nomalized_base_url is part of the tags for the site. -->
- Add stale analysis check - or just figure out cron jobs for automated re-analysis. That way it's not triggered by user query, hence a faster reponse - better UX.
<!-- - Add live updates regarding analysis progress. -->
- Tighten up the scoring rubric a bit - sites are performing a bit too well.
