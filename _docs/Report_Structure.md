> **Note:**  
> • You may use tools like AI or Copilot to support planning, structuring, or reviewing your work,  
> but the core ideas, justifications, and originality must be your own.  
> • Be prepared to defend every aspect of your proposal in your own words during the oral presentation.  
> • Use proper citations in your proposal for all external references, tools, and content (including AI-generated material, if applicable).

## Chapter Guidelines

### 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** Give a general overview of the domain or area you are exploring.

- Set the context: Why is this domain relevant today?
- Identify the gap or need you want to address.
- Avoid buzzwords and hype; focus on clarity.
- Keep it under 1 page.

> 💡 *Tip:* Do not let AI write this for you. Think of it as explaining your project to a friend who is in a different field.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

**Purpose:** Clearly define the real-world problem your project addresses.

- State what the problem is.
- Who is affected? Why is it important to solve it?
- Use evidence: a statistic, observation, or citation from literature or industry.
- Avoid vague or generic problems.

**Example:**  
“Smallholder farmers in Kenya lack timely weather-based crop advisories, leading to poor planting decisions.”

---

### 3. Objectives

**Purpose:** Define what your project aims to achieve.

- Use SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
- List 3–5 objectives.
- Distinguish between primary and secondary objectives.

**Weak:** “Build a website.”  
**Improved:**  
1. Design a responsive web platform for real-time weather alerts tailored for rural farmers.  
2. Implement the design in 1. above.

### 4. Literature Review

**Purpose:** Show you have studied existing work in your area.

- Summarize at least 5 relevant sources (academic papers, industry reports, standards, etc.).
- Group findings thematically (e.g., techniques, success factors, limitations).
- Identify gaps or limitations that your project will address.
- Properly cite all references using APA/IEEE/Harvard style.
- Do not copy AI-generated summaries—review and write in your own words.

> ✅ Do: Use Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ResearchGate  
> ❌ Avoid: Copying from AI tools or other summarizers

### 5. Proposed System Architecture

**Purpose:** Present a high-level design of your system.

- Describe components/modules (backend, frontend, database, APIs, ML models, etc.).
- Include a simple architecture diagram (block diagram or flowchart).
- Show how the components interact and data flows between them.
- Explain technology choices (frameworks, libraries, platforms) with justification.

> 🛠️ Tip: Use draw.io or Lucidchart for clean diagrams.

### 6. Methodology

**Purpose:** Describe your development and/or research approach.

- Mention whether you will use Agile, Waterfall, or another model.
- Describe phases (requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment).
- State your data collection or evaluation approach (especially for ML or user studies).
- Include how you will track progress (sprints, milestones).

**If using AI (e.g., LLMs, image classification), state:**
- Why AI is appropriate
- Which model you plan to use
- How you will train/test it
- Ethical use and limitations

---

### 7. Timeline

**Purpose:** Break your project into weekly deliverables.

- Use a Gantt chart or table format (Weeks 1–15).
- Link activities to milestones (e.g., proposal, MVP, final system).
- Highlight critical deadlines (e.g., testing, final report submission).

> 📊 Tools: spreadsheets, GanttProject

---

### 8. Budget

**Purpose:** Estimate the cost of completing your project.

- Include items like:
  - Hosting fees
  - Cloud computing time
  - Devices or sensors
  - Transport for data collection
  - Printing/Documentation
- Indicate if the project can be completed with zero cost and how.

> ❗ Don’t just put "N/A"—think through any resources you need.

---

### 9. Ethical Considerations

**Purpose:** Demonstrate responsibility in your project.

- Discuss data privacy (if you are collecting user data)
- Address bias or fairness (especially for AI projects)
- Mention user safety, accessibility, and usability
- Declare if you’re using public datasets or open-source code responsibly

> 🚨 Red flag: “We will collect sensitive data but have no plan to secure it.”

---

### 10. References

**Purpose:** Acknowledge your sources.

- Use a consistent citation style (APA, Harvard, or IEEE).
- Include scholarly sources, websites, and documentation for libraries/tools.
- Cite AI tools only if used for specific code generation or ideas.

**Example citation (APA):**  
OpenAI. (2023). *ChatGPT (Mar 2023 version) [Large language model].* https://chat.openai.com/

## 🚫 Inappropriate AI Use!

You may use AI tools to help:
- Brainstorm ideas
- Correct grammar
- Review structure

But **do NOT**:
- Copy-paste AI-generated content
- Use AI for your literature review, problem statement, or objectives

> ❗ You must be able to explain every section in your own words during Q&A.  
> Misuse of AI may lead to **proposal rejection**.
