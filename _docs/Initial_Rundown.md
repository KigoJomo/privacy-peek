# Problem statement
  The average internet user does not have the time, resources or expertise to navigate the complex world of online data ownership and privacy. This leads to a lack of understanding and awareness of their rights and options, resulting in uninformed consent and potential misuse of their personal data.

  Users are often required to agree to lengthy and complex policy documents. This creates a barrier to informed consent, as many users do not read or fully understand these documents.

  The key issue to address is the knowledge gap in data ownership and privacy practices. Bridging this gap by presenting data privacy information in a simple and easy-to-understand way would result in users making informed decisions about their data, leading to better data practices and improved online privacy.

# Objectives
By November 2025, I will have completed the following milestones:

## 1. AI-Enabled Policy Analysis Engine
Develop an AI-enabled policy analysis engine with three core functionalities (URL discovery, content parsing, and metadata extraction) that successfully processes policy documents across 5 privacy categories with relevance scores greater than 0.3, leveraging existing NLP technologies to make complex policies digestible for users within 3 weeks of project start.

**Specific**: Develop an engine with three core functionalities: URL discovery, content parsing/analysis, and metadata extraction across 5 privacy categories (Data Collection, Sharing, Retention, User Rights/Controls, Transparency).

**Measurable**: Successfully extract clauses with relevance scores greater than 0.3 for each of the 5 categories, returning structured clauses and metadata for any website with privacy policies.

**Achievable**: Building on existing NLP and web scraping technologies, with clear technical requirements and defined output formats.

**Relevant**: Addresses the core problem of making complex policy documents digestible and understandable for average users.

**Time-bound**: Complete within 3 weeks of project start.

## 2. Privacy Scoring Mechanism
Design and implement a privacy scoring algorithm that evaluates extracted policy clauses using weighted rubrics to generate category-specific scores (0-10) and overall privacy scores (0-100) with simple reasoning statements, building on established methodologies to transform complex policy information into actionable insights within 3 weeks after the analysis engine completion.

**Specific**: Develop a scoring algorithm that evaluates extracted policy clauses using weighted rubrics to generate category-specific scores (0-10) and overall privacy scores (0-100).

**Measurable**: Produce numerical scores with supporting reasoning statements written in simple, non-technical language for each privacy category.

**Achievable**: Based on established scoring methodologies and the structured data output from the analysis engine.

**Relevant**: Transforms complex policy information into actionable insights that users can easily understand and compare.

**Time-bound**: Complete implementation within 3 weeks after completion of the policy analysis engine.

## 3. Browser Extension
Create a functional Chrome extension that detects login pages, policy page visits, and manual interactions to display integrated privacy scores in a popup interface, providing real-time privacy information at decision-making points and publishing on Chrome Web Store within 3 weeks of scoring engine completion.

**Specific**: Create a Chrome extension that detects login pages, policy page visits, and manual icon clicks to display privacy scores in a popup interface.

**Measurable**: Extension fully integrated with scoring engine and published on Chrome Web Store with functional popup displaying privacy scores.

**Achievable**: Leverages standard browser extension APIs and existing scoring infrastructure.

**Relevant**: Provides real-time privacy information at the point of user decision-making.

**Time-bound**: Published on Chrome Web Store within 3 weeks of scoring engine completion.

## 4. Web-Based Dashboard
Build a responsive web-based dashboard featuring search functionality, comparative analysis tools, detailed score breakdowns, and automated bi-weekly re-analysis, delivering an MVP with 30 pre-analyzed websites using standard web development practices within 3 weeks of scoring engine completion.

**Specific**: Build a responsive dashboard featuring search functionality, comparative analysis tools, detailed score breakdowns, and automated bi-weekly re-analysis.

**Measurable**: MVP with privacy scores for 30 pre-analyzed websites, fully functional search and comparison features.

**Achievable**: Standard web development practices with integration to existing analysis and scoring systems.

**Relevant**: Provides comprehensive privacy research and comparison capabilities for informed decision-making.

**Time-bound**: Present MVP within 3 weeks of completing the scoring engine, with ongoing bi-weekly updates.
