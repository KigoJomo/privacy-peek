# Privacy Peek - Project Overview

---

## Slide 1: The Problem 🚨

### Complex Privacy Policies = Uninformed Users

- Only 21% of consumers feel confident about how their data is used
- 81% believe data collection risks outweigh benefits
- 45% of apps access sensitive info without good reason
- Users spend <30 seconds scanning policies before agreeing

Reality: Users can't understand complex legal documents but must agree to access services

---

## Slide 2: What Privacy Peek Addresses 🎯

### Bridging the Knowledge Gap

Core Issues:

- Complexity: Privacy policies are too technical for average users
- Time: No one has time to read lengthy legal documents
- Context: Users need privacy info at decision-making moments
- Comparison: No way to compare privacy practices across sites

Our Solution: Transform complex policies into simple, actionable insights

## Slide 3: How We Solve It 🛠️

### AI-Powered Privacy Analysis

1. Automatic Detection & Analysis

- Browser extension detects login pages & policy visits
- AI extracts and analyzes privacy policy content
- Processes 5 key categories: Data Collection, Sharing, Retention, User Rights, Transparency

2. Smart Scoring System

- Generates 0-10 scores per category using weighted rubrics
- Creates overall privacy score (0-100)
- Provides simple reasoning in plain language

3. Real-Time Delivery

- Chrome extension popup shows scores at critical moments
- Web dashboard for detailed comparisons and research
