## 1. Introduction

In the modern digital age, internet users are constantly required to share personal data with various online services. This exchange is typically governed by privacy policies and terms of service agreements, which are often lengthy, legally complex, and difficult for the average person to understand. Consequently, a significant gap exists between the data rights users have and their practical ability to exercise them. Many users consent to data practices without full awareness of the implications, leading to potential misuse of their personal information and a general erosion of digital trust.

This project, Privacy Peek, aims to address this knowledge gap. By providing tools that automatically analyze and simplify privacy policies, we can empower users to make informed decisions about their data. The goal is to enhance digital transparency and equip users with clear, accessible insights into how their personal information is managed by the websites they visit, fostering a safer and more transparent online environment.

## 2. Problem Statement

The core problem is that the average internet user lacks the time, resources, and legal expertise to navigate the complex world of online data privacy. Users are frequently confronted with lengthy and convoluted policy documents that they must accept to access services. This practice creates a significant barrier to informed consent, as most users either do not read these documents or cannot fully comprehend their content.

This information asymmetry affects nearly every internet user and leads to a lack of awareness regarding their data rights and options. The consequence is uninformed consent, which can result in the misuse of personal data and a diminished ability for users to control their digital footprint. The key issue to be addressed is this critical knowledge gap; bridging it will enable users to make conscious choices, promoting better data privacy practices across the web.

## 3. Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive system that analyzes, scores, and presents website privacy policies in an easily understandable format. This will be achieved through the following primary objectives, which are designed to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound).

**Primary Objectives:**

1.  **Develop an AI-Enabled Policy Analysis Engine:** To create an AI-powered engine that discovers, parses, and extracts key metadata from privacy policy documents across five distinct privacy categories (Data Collection, Sharing, Retention, User Rights/Controls, and Transparency). The engine will be considered successful when it processes policies and achieves relevance scores greater than 0.3 for each category. This is to be completed within the first three weeks of the project.

2.  **Implement a Privacy Scoring Mechanism:** To design and implement a privacy scoring algorithm that evaluates the extracted policy clauses using a weighted rubric. This will generate category-specific scores (0-10) and an overall privacy score (0-100), accompanied by simple reasoning statements. This objective builds on the output of the analysis engine and is scheduled for completion within three weeks following the engine's completion.

**Secondary Objectives:**

3.  **Create a Functional Browser Extension:** To build a Chrome extension that integrates with the scoring engine to display privacy scores in a simple popup interface. The extension will activate on login pages, policy page visits, or manual user interaction, providing real-time insights. The extension is to be published on the Chrome Web Store within three weeks of the scoring engine's completion.

4.  **Build a Web-Based Dashboard:** To develop a responsive web dashboard that allows users to search for websites, compare their privacy scores, and view detailed report breakdowns. The dashboard will be launched with an MVP featuring 30 pre-analyzed websites and will include automated bi-weekly re-analysis of sites. The MVP is to be presented within three weeks of the scoring engine's completion.
