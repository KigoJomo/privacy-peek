# 1. Introduction
  This project focuses on the current state of online data ownership, privacy, and the rules and standards around that. Ownership and privacy of data is important as it allows individuals to control their personal information, prevent misuse (like identity theft and fraud) and build trust with other people and businesses.

  The current state of online data privacy presents a gap in how individuals are able to control their data. Majority of online services and platforms are able to take advantage of the data literacy gap on the internet. Everyday average users are presented with complex _Terms of Service_ and _Privacy Policy_ statements.These are usually lengthy and contain a lot of technical and legal jargon that makes it difficult for individuals to understand or even read in some cases. This creates the illusion of informed consent - a loophole that many platforms are able and ready to exploit.

  Without proper informed consent, individuals find themselves giving away their personal data. This data takes on a life of its own from that point - it goes through multiple third parties, at which point the original owner has no control over it and how it is used. Such unethical intentions are usually written vaguely and in the fine-print of the long and complex policy documents - in other words, **hidden in plain sight**.

  In essence, the state of data privacy and ownership is not all sunshine and rainbows as may be presented to us by the very authors of the policies we blindly agree to. There exists a critical gap in public awareness, a gap which if not bridged, will make it forever impossible to improve online data practices.

# 2. Problem Statement
  Online data practices is a complex topic, but does not need to be presented as such to the people that matter - but unfortunately, that is exactly how it is presented. There is little effort to interpret the topic for all individuals to get a clear understanding of it.
  Web platforms, data brokers, third-party advertisers and other entities use this complexity as a shield for their practices, making it difficult for individuals to challenge or question them.
